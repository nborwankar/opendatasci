			<td><span class="category_data">This entry gives the basic form of government. Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that for some countries more than one definition applies.):

<br><b>Absolute monarchy</b> - a form of government where the monarch rules unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally organized opposition.

<br><b>Anarchy</b> - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought about by the absence of governmental authority.     

<br><b>Authoritarian</b> - a form of government in which state authority is imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.

<br><b>Commonwealth</b> - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.     

<br><b>Communist</b> - a system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people (i.e., a classless society).     

<br><b>Confederacy (Confederation)</b> - a union by compact or treaty between states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority over all matters except those delegated to the central government.     

<br><b>Constitutional</b> - a government by or operating under an authoritative document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of that government.     

<br><b>Constitutional democracy</b> - a form of government in which the sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.       

<br><b>Constitutional monarchy</b> - a system of government in which a monarch is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.     

<br><b>Democracy</b> - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.     

<br><b>Democratic republic</b> - a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them.     

<br><b>Dictatorship</b> - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).     

<br><b>Ecclesiastical</b> - a government administrated by a church.

<br><b>Emirate</b> - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority.      

<br><b>Federal (Federation)</b> - a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a central authority and a number of constituent regions (states, colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as upon the regional units.     

<br><b>Federal republic</b> - a state in which the powers of the central government are restricted and in which the component parts (states, colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental representatives.

<br><b>Islamic republic</b> - a particular form of government adopted by some Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the laws of Islam.      

<br><b>Maoism</b> - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch with the people.     

<br><b>Marxism</b> - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by 19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists (business owners), to a socialist "dictatorship of the proletariat," to, finally, a classless society - Communism.      

<br><b>Marxism-Leninism</b> - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed to underdeveloped countries.     

<br><b>Monarchy</b> - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with constitutionally limited authority.     

<br><b>Oligarchy</b> - a government in which control is exercised by a small group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.     

<br><b>Parliamentary democracy</b> - a political system in which the legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the parliament.      

<br><b>Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government)</b> - a government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer function.     

<br><b>Parliamentary monarchy</b> - a state headed by a monarch who is not actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity); true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a legislature (parliament).     

<br><b>Presidential</b> - a system of government where the executive branch exists separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not accountable). 

<br><b>Republic</b> - a representative democracy in which the people's elected deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on legislation.

<br><b>Socialism</b> - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.     

<br><b>Sultanate</b> - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority.     

<br><b>Theocracy</b> - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government subject to religious authority.

<br><b>Totalitarian</b> - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.</span></td>
